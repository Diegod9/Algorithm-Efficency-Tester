# Algorithm-Efficency-Tester
Implementing the most common sorting algorithms
Then testing the time it takes for each type of sort to sort an array of random integers, size of array based on user input, with different ordering.
The array has three types of ordering before beong sorted
  1.Inversely ordered
  2.Randomly ordered
  3.Ordered
Then each sort sorts the same array in those three orders and displays the amount of time it took to sort each type of array.
